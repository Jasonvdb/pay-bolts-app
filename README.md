# pay-bolts-app
Lightning network remote app for a [c-lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning) node. 
Built with React Native (Both iOS and Android)

For the API you'll need [c-lightning-express](https://github.com/Jasonvdb/c-lightning-express) (A NodeJS rest API for controlling your node)

If you don't have a c-lightning node setup, try this guide: https://medium.com/@Jayvdb/setting-up-and-transacting-on-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-a9ada42ec305
